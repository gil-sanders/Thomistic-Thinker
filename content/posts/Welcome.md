This is not a new blog; in fact, it’s been here for quite a while now but posting was a rare occurrence. Unfortunately I have always found myself **consuming** content (or debating over social media) rather than **producing** content. This has been a lifelong problem of mine. It’s easy to consume; much harder to produce things of value. So after deleting my social media, I’ve restarted this blog in attempt to overcome this vice. 

Philosophy, after all, isn’t *merely* about thinking very hard; it’s also about living virtuously and wisely for God, yourself, and the good of others. However, what I loved about social media is being challenged by others. Good thinking and intellectual humility isn’t done alone but is acquired in a community of thinkers. 

The goal of this blog then is to share my thoughts and converse with a community of thinkers from varying perspectives. I myself am a Christian philosopher with a broadly Thomistic perspective of the world -- i.e, I consider myself a realist about many things, and I proudly defend common sense as correct on most things. 

I’ll be sharing my thoughts, respond to articles / videos, review books, share links of interest, and converse with fellow thinkers. 

Thanks for reading!
